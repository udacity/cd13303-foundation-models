    "A foundation model serves as a fundamental building block for potentially endless applications. One application we will explore in this exercise is the development of a spam email classifier, using the power of zero-shot learning. By leveraging the capabilities of a foundation model, this project aims to accurately identify and filter out unwanted and potentially harmful emails, enhancing user experience and security.\n",

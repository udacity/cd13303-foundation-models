    "# Exercise: Analyze the risks of using a foundation model\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's digital age, the use of foundation models has become increasingly prevalent in various industries. However, it is crucial to analyze the risks associated with these models to ensure their ethical and responsible implementation. This analysis involves examining potential biases that may be embedded within the foundation models, the privacy concerns that arise from their usage, and the impact on labor and the environment. In this exercise, you will dive deeper into two topics of your choice, one suggested by a foundation model and another you come up with yourself."
